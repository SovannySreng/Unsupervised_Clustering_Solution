# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project uses K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their spending scores and annual incomes. The solution is modularized into various scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
- `eda.py`: Functions for performing exploratory data analysis.
- `model_training.py`: Functions for training the K-Means clustering model.
- `evaluation.py`: Functions for evaluating the model using WCSS and silhouette scores.
- `visualization.py`: Functions for visualizing the clusters and evaluation metrics.
- `main.py`: The main script that ties all the modules together.
